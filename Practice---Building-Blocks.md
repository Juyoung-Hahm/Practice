**Learning assessment:** Write a named code chunk that creates a
dataframe comprised of: a numeric variable containing a random sample of
size 500 from a normal variable with mean 1; a logical vector indicating
whether each sampled value is greater than zero; and a numeric vector
containing the absolute value of each element. Then, produce a histogram
of the absolute value variable just created. Add an inline summary
giving the median value rounded to two decimal places.

The median of the variable containing absolute value is 1.05.

**Learning assessment:** After the previous code chunk, write a bullet
list given the mean, median, and standard deviation of the original
random sample.

- The mean of the random sample is: 1.0317565.
- The median of the random sample is: 1.0496895.
- The standard deviation of the random sample is: 0.987799.
